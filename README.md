# Playwright-Huel

Here is my submission for the Huel JR QA Technical Task.

I throughly enjoyed taking on this task and learned quite a lot about Playwright and it's inner workings.

Once major issue I encountered with Playwright was using the Codegen to find locators and assertions and then using the test ui to run the tests. A lot of freezes and timeouts occurred.

I found out that the testing section within VSCode and running the debug mode was a lot more reliable.

Page hydration was a an issue when navigating through the webpage and trying to replicate the user's customer journey. The naming conventions on the website had to be exact to find the product and I made sure to take the longest, simplest journey when adding items and checking out. (Not using the product navbar for ease of use).

Page Object model would have been an easier way of navigating and making the code a lot cleaner to understand when refactoring.
